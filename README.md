2D top-down maze game example.

![With graphic](./screen.png)

My goal was to figure out by myself how to implement map scrolling. 

DONE
- importing map from the [editor](https://github.com/gamedevnull/2dmapeditor)
- partial map rendering in the viewport
- scrolling when the player moves around
- wall collisions
- enemy collisions
- game states
- shooting
